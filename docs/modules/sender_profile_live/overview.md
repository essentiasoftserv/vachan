# Sender Profile Module# Sender Profile Module

# Overview

    Vachan.SenderProfiles.SenderProfile is a module in the Vachan application that manages sender profiles for email gateways. It leverages the Ash framework and uses AshPostgres as the data layer to handle database interactions. This module is responsible for storing, validating, and managing configuration parameters such as SMTP settings and user credentials, which are essential for sending emails through different email service providers.

# What does the feature do?

    -Manages Email Gateway Configuration: It allows users to store configuration parameters necessary for sending emails, including provider information, credentials (username, password), SMTP host and port details, and sender identity details (name, email, title).

    -CRUD Operations: The module supports standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on sender profiles, providing an interface to create new profiles, read existing ones, update them, and delete them.

    -Validation: Implements validation rules to ensure data integrity. For example, it enforces specific constraints on email formats, username length, and password strength.

    -Multitenancy Support: It supports multitenancy by segregating sender profiles based on organization_id, allowing different organizations to maintain separate configurations.

    -API Interface: Defines a code interface for external modules to interact with sender profiles using actions like create, update, destroy, and read_all.

    -Pagination: Provides paginated access to lists of sender profiles to efficiently manage large sets of data.

# What dependencies does it have?

    -Ash Framework: Provides the core functionality for resources, actions, validations, and multitenancy.
    -AshPostgres: A specific Ash data layer for interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
    -Vachan.Repo: The Ecto repository module that connects to the PostgreSQL database.
    -Regex: Used for validation to ensure the format of attributes like email, username, and password.
    -Ecto: For database interactions, including changesets and querying.
    -Logger: For logging purposes (implicitly through Ash and other modules).

# Where can the user access it from?

    -API Endpoints: Users can access sender profile features through API endpoints exposed by the Vachan application (not explicitly shown in the module but assumed to be set up in routes and controllers).
    -Admin Interface: It could be accessed through an admin interface where administrators can manage email gateway configurations (depending on the larger application setup).
    -External Modules: Other modules in the Vachan application can interact with sender profiles using defined actions like create, update, get_by_id, etc.

# Submodules and Details

    -resource do ... end=> Describes the resource and provides a brief description of its purpose (storing configuration parameters for email gateways).
    -postgres do ... end=> Specifies the table name (sender_profiles) and the repository (Vachan.Repo) used for interacting with the database.
    -multitenancy do ... end=> Defines the multitenancy strategy using an attribute (organization_id). Each sender profile is associated with a specific organization.
    -code_interface do ... end=> Defines a set of functions (create, update, destroy, read_all, get_by_id, list) that provide an external interface for interacting with sender profiles.
    -actions do ... end=> Lists default actions (read, create, update, destroy) and specifies details for each, including custom actions like by_id for fetching by ID and list for paginated fetching.
    -attributes do ... end=> Defines the schema attributes for the sender profile, including primary key (id), and other attributes like provider, username, password, api_key, smtp_host, smtp_port, name, email, and title.
    Sets constraints and default values for these attributes.
    -validations do ... end=>Lists validation rules to ensure data integrity, such as checking email format, enforcing minimum and maximum lengths for usernames and passwords, and ensuring SMTP port is numeric.
    -identities do ... end=> Defines unique constraints, ensuring that attributes like title must be unique.
    -relationships do ... end=> Establishes relationships with other modules. A sender profile can have many campaigns (through Vachan.Massmail.Campaign) and belongs to an organization (through Vachan.Organizations.Organization).
